# graph_1
This is an assignment where Graph.h / Graph.cpp & GraphTest.cpp were given by professor:
- Build the Graph: undirected/ undirected weighted / directed / directed weighted
- Build a dot file for pictorial representation of this graph
- Traverse the graph using DFS, to find the topological graph & return if cycle is found

Following are the files I have added or edited:
- GraphBuilder.h & GraphBuilder.cpp
- GraphDot.h & Graph.cpp
- GraphDfs.h & Graph.cpp
- Added few function to util.h & util.cpp

Refer the pdf files to see the output of Graphs & DFS (the dot files once generated need to be converted to pdf files using the command)
